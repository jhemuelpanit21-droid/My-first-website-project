        <p> Gundam info and where to buy </p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 2 em;"> Gundam model kits, also known as Gunpla (short for "Gundam plastic model"), are highly detailed, buildable replicas of the iconic mecha from the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. Ranging from beginner friendly snap fit kits to advanced, intricately engineered models, Gunpla offers something for hobbyists of all skill levels. These kits come in different grades and scales such as High Grade (HG), Real Grade (RG), Master Grade (MG), and Perfect Grade (PG), and also there are metal buils. Each offering unique levels of detail, articulation, and complexity. Building Gunpla is not only a creative and rewarding hands on experience but also a way for fans to connect with the Gundam universe, customize their own mecha designs, and display them as part of a growing collection. </h1>
